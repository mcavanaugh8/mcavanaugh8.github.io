Here's how the process should work:
    1. App initially loads with no players. Draft board loads with just 3 columns: pick position, team, and the input field for the actual pick
    2. User adds a player
        1. player and his picks to the localStorage participants array
        2. player's selections are programmatically added into the draft board
