Here's how the process should work:
    1. App initially loads with no players. Draft board loads with just 3 columns: pick position, team, and the input field for the actual pick
    2. User adds a player (addPlayers())
        1. player and his picks to the localStorage participants array
        2. player's selections are programmatically added into the draft board
        3. player's name and score are added to the scoreboard

TO DO
-----
- need to create a user system
- need logic so that same player can't be selected twice
- users should be able to store drafts in their account

MODES:
- upload a mock draft, store it in the system (these will be graded later on)
- LIVE DRAFT



DONE
-----
- on reload, draft order should reload too â€“ not just the picks!
- put a player number next to player's name on scoreboard and their selection on draftboard; should be a superscript <sup></sup>
- whenever draft is reordered (because of trades), there needs to be a new draft object made. And the trades need to persist on reload
- If a new participant is added after draft starts, draft-results object should not reset
