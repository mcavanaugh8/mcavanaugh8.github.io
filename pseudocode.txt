Here's how the process should work:
    1. App initially loads with no players. Draft board loads with just 3 columns: pick position, team, and the input field for the actual pick
    2. User adds a player (addPlayers())
        1. player and his picks to the localStorage participants array
        2. player's selections are programmatically added into the draft board
        3. player's name and score are added to the scoreboard

- on reload, draft order should reload too â€“ not just the picks!
- whenever draft is reordered (because of trades), there needs to be a new draft object made. And the trades need to persist on reload
- need logic so that same player can't be selected twice
